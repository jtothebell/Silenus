A Parser and renderer for Adoble Flash Files

This is a branch of Sileni Studios' Silenus (https://code.google.com/p/silenus/). It parses Adoble Flash files (.fla) and either renders them in java, or outputs a json representation of the files for rendering later on another platform. There is included here an HTML 5 renderer as well as the java renderer.

I've tried to contact the original developers about adding in some changes to their main branch, but have never heard back, so I have started this new branch. 

The original project has an MIT license, and this branch maintains the same.
