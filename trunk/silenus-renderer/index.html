		<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/silenus" target="_blank">Silenus</a> is an <b>open source</b> java library developed by <a href="http://www.silenistudios.com">Sileni Studios</a> that parses and interprets an Adobe Flash .FLA file. It can export this data in a clean, efficient JSON format ready for use in your browser. Silenus comes as a standalone library, which you can integrate in your java application, or as a stand-alone JAR file that will read your .FLA file and save the JSON data to disk. Silenus also comes with a javascript-based renderer, which will take the JSON data and render them to a canvas element.</p>
		
		<p>The animation below was directly exported from a .FLA file and is rendered live using the javascript renderer. It consists of 24 body parts in a complex tree hierarchy, and is a sample from <a href="http://TODO" target="_blank">Castle Quest</a>, the game currently under development by Sileni Studios. Silenus was developed to form a bridge between artists working in Flash, and programmers writing their game with HTML5 technologies.</p>
		
		<p>Below the animation you can find a flow-chart describing the Silenus approach. For a full list of features and documentation, please refer to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/silenus" target="_blank">Google code project</a>.</p>
